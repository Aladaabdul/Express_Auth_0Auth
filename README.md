# Authorization Using 0Auth 

This project is a web application designed to provide secure user authentication using OAuth. 
OAuth is a widely adopted authentication protocol that enables users to log in to web applications using their existing credentials from third-party identity providers. 
In this case, we have implemented OAuth using the Auth0 authentication service.
